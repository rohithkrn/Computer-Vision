rotate_image.m -- this function rotates the image. 
function [I2] = rotate_image(I1,theta,p0) .this is funciton signature. I1 is the input image, theta is angle of rotation, p0 is thepoint to rotate about wrt to image.
Project_3d.m -- this code computes the projections of teapot for all 4 camera matrices.
Use project_image.m function to generate projections of individual cameras. function [I] =  project_image(Str,K,R,t) is the function signature where R and t are orientation and translation of cameras.
PLease run Project_3d.m before using project_image to get all the variables.
